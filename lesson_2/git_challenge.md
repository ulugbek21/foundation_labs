# Git Challenge 1

1. Go to the test repository on Github, and directly modify the README by
   clicking the pencil button. Add a change, and commit it.

2. Now, there's a change on the remote repo which is not available in the local
   repo. How do we get those changes? Go to your local repo, and run a "pull"
   command: `git pull origin master`.

3. Create three files named `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt` in your
   local repository. Add some text to each one.

4. Stage, commit, and push `file1.txt` to your remote repository. Refresh the
   URL on your GitHub page. Do you see your commit?

5. Stage, commit, and push `file2.txt` and `file3.txt` to your remote repository
   as a *single* commit.

# Git Challenge 2

1. Divide yourselves into groups of 3.

2. Have one person act as the "maintainer" and the other two act as
   "contributors" A and B.

3. The maintainer creates a repository with a `README.md` file so that it can
   immediately be cloned. This file is pushed to the remote.

4. The maintainer adds contributors A and B as collaborators on the project
   (click "Settings" --> "Collaborators" --> "Add collaborator").

5. The maintainer creates a file named `animals.txt` and adds their favorite
   animal to this file.

6. Contributors A and B clone this repository and each add their favorite
   animals to this file. Stage, commit, and push the changes to the original
   repo.

7. Contributors A and B then create a pull request (click the "Pull Request"
   button) so the Maintainer can see the proposed changes.

8. Maintainer reviews changes and accepts the proposed changes.
